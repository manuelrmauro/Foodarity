### Description

We programmed a Market Place to sell food. 
I worked on the Back-end area and controlling the flow of information between Front and Back, some of the features I did were the shopping cart, product publication and sales completion.
Build with JavaScript, Node, React, Redux, CSS, Express, Sequelize. 


### How to open

*You will need to connect the database with your postgres.*
*Look for the file ".envexample" in "/backend" and "/frontend", you will need to complete all the keys if you want to test all the features.*

<ol>
    <li>Clone or download the repository</li>
    <li>Open a terminal in '/backend' and run 'npm install'</li>
    <li>Then run 'npm start'</li>
    <li>Open a new terminal in '/frontend' and run 'npm install'</li>
    <li>Then run 'npm start'</li>
    <li>If you want to use the backoffice, open another new terminal in '/backoffice' and run 'npm install'</li>
    <li>Then run 'npm start'</li>
    <li>Enjoy it! üòÅ</li>
